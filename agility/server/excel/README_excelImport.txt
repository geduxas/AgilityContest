WHAT DOES BLIND MODE MEANS:

Blind Mode means that user assumes existing data in AgilityContest Database matches with their counterpart in Excel file, or not exists. No check are performed, and no user action is requested. Searches are done by exact match, no similar names
- Club/Country MUST exist in database and match name. Else error will be shown
- If a handler with matching name and club is found in database, will be used. Otherwise a new handler will be created
- If a dog with matching name and handler is found in database, will be used. Otherwise, a new dog will be created
